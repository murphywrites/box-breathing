    <p>Box breathing is a powerful but simple relaxation technique that aims to return breathing to its normal rhythm after a stressful experience. It involves breathing in and out and holding the breath. It may help clear the mind, relax the body, and improve focus.</p>
    
    <p>Box breathing involves four basic steps, each lasting 4 seconds:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>breathing in</li>
      <li>holding the breath</li>
      <li>breathing out</li>
      <li>holding the breath</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>Box breathing, also known as resetting the breath or four-square breathing, is easy to do, quick to learn, and can be highly effective in stressful situations.</p>
    
    <p>People with high stress jobs, such as soldiers and police officers, often use box breathing when their bodies are in fight-or-flight mode. This technique is also relevant for anyone interested in re-centering themselves or improving their concentration.</p>
